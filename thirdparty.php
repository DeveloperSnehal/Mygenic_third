														<p>Third-party manufacturers, also known as contract manufacturers, are companies that manufacture products on behalf of another company. In the pharmaceutical industry, third-party manufacturers are often used to produce drugs and other healthcare products.</p>
														<p>Third-party manufacturers work under a contract with the hiring company to manufacture a product according to their specifications, usually for a fee. The hiring company may provide the raw materials, packaging, and labeling instructions, while the third-party manufacturer provides the facilities, equipment, and labor needed for production.</p>
                                                        <p>Using a third-party manufacturer can be a cost-effective way for a company to produce products without having to invest in expensive equipment or facilities. It also allows the company to focus on other aspects of their business, such as marketing and distribution.</p>
