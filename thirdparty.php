														<p>Contract manufacturers, also known as third-party manufacturers, are companies that make products for other companies. In the pharmaceutical industry, they are often chosen to produce medicines and healthcare items.</p>
														<p>Third-party manufacturers work under a contract with the hiring company to manufacture a product according to their specifications, usually for a fee. The hiring company may provide the raw materials, packaging, and labeling instructions, while the third-party manufacturer provides the facilities, equipment, and labor needed for production.</p>
                                                        <p>Using a contract manufacturer can be beneficial for companies because it helps them save money by avoiding the need to buy expensive equipment or facilities. It also allows them to focus on other important parts of their business, such as marketing and distribution.</p>

                                                        <p><b>Private Label Manufacturers:</b> These companies produce items for other companies, but the products carry the brand name of the purchasing company. Private-label manufacturers can make various products, including pharmaceuticals.</p>
                                                        <p>To sum it up, any company with the necessary knowledge, equipment, and facilities can become a contract manufacturer for pharmaceutical products.</p>
