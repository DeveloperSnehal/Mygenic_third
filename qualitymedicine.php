														<p>In the pharmaceutical industry, there are two important certifications that companies can earn: WHO certification and GMP certification.</p>
                                                        <p>WHO certification is given to companies that meet the standards set by the World Health Organization. These standards ensure that pharmaceutical products are safe, effective, and of good quality. Having WHO certification shows that a company is recognized globally for its excellence in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
                                                        <p>GMP certification consists of guidelines established by regulatory bodies to ensure that pharmaceutical products are made, tested, and controlled according to quality standards. These guidelines cover different aspects of the manufacturing process, such as raw materials, facilities, equipment, and personnel. When a company is GMP certified, it means they have shown their commitment to following these guidelines and maintaining the highest quality standards for their products.</p>
